# -What-are-some-modern-techniques-used-in-IVF-labs-to-improve-fertilization-rates-

IVF has changed a lot over the years. Itâ€™s not just about mixing sperm and egg anymore. Modern clinics use many cool tools to improve success:

ICSI: Injecting sperm directly into the egg. Helps in male infertility.

Laser-Assisted Hatching: Helps embryo break from shell before implantation.

Blastocyst Culture: Growing embryos till Day 5 for better selection.

Time-Lapse Imaging: Monitors embryos 24/7 without removing them.

Embryo Glue: A special medium to help embryo stick to uterus lining.

Freezing/Vitrification: Safely freezes embryos for later use without damage.

These small steps can make a big impact. Trinity IVF uses all of these depending on whatâ€™s needed for each case. They donâ€™t overdo itâ€”but they do personalize it.
